As part of the natural cycle of side projects, I work on a lot of side projects that don't deserve an entire page of content. Here is a small sample of those projects:

**Puzzle for Brandon**

A hellishly long series of CTF-like puzzles unleashed upon a friend as a birthday gift in 2020, with an Amazon gift card as the prize for completion. He has never completed it. I'll add more detailed info once I give him the gift card and walk him through the entire thing. I recently looked at my planning document and realized just how *incredibly insane* this project was, and that's hilarious.

**Disneyland Waittimes**

Before I knew about Disney Genie (a poorly designed product for reasons I will delve into shortly), I thought it would be fun to make my own Disneyland trip planner program before I went on a trip there with my sister. I eventually learned that any attempts to plan a trip before going are made in vain.

The project consisted of three parts: a way to fetch and store wait times, a way to display a graph of wait times, and an attempt to minimize the time it takes to complete a set of rides when factoring in walking time, waiting time, and ride length. The fetching of wait times was done using a third-party Node.js API, and wait times were simply stored in my Git repo. This ran and updated for a number of months, which is why the repo currently has over a thousand(!!!) commits. The graph was a simple render of the data, with the ability to set what ride and park you viewed. The trip planning website tried multiple strategies, ultimately using a "bubble sort-esqe" algorithm to make a half-decent guess at a itinerary based on the information it was given. This was a pain, as it really was trying to estimate the NP-hard travelling salesman problem, but with additional steps (like wait times!). Ultimately, though, this wasn't even the main problem!

The main problem with this is how variable wait times are. Alongside unforseen circumstances, such as ride breakdowns that are common at Disneyland, the patterns of wait times from day-to-day are so inconsistent that it is almost always a better idea to play it by ear instead, which is what my sister and I ended up doing when we went, and we were able to do everything we wanted, and them some (though, I guess prior knowledge of park layout and rough intuition on wait time patterns helped quite a bit with this).

The source code for this is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/aekaisato/disneyland-waittimes). This was never meant to be released publicly, so everything about the repo is a mess.

**Bookmark Formatter**

This project was a simple way for me to practice a bit of my functional programming skills with Racket, a dialect of Lisp. It's a very simple script that takes a folder of yaml files and parses them to a bookmark import format supported by Firefox and Chromium-based browsers using HTML. The entire thing was slapped together in a day. Source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/aekaisato/bookmark-formatter).

**Random Hackathon Stuff**

I did a couple of virtual hackathons in my junior year of high school with a couple people at my school. I'm honestly not happy with the results at all, but it's something that I did. [Hymn, a home gym workout tracker.](https://devpost.com/software/hymn-gzjxti) [CoVCast, a COVID-19 forecast app](https://devpost.com/software/covcast). (To be fair, I didn't come up with the ideas here, I just contributed to code and UI design.)
