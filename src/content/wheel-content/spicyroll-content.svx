I wanted to use picture-in-picture mode to watch anime on Crunchyroll while doing other stuff. Unfortunately, due to the way Crunchyroll displays subs on their site, subtitles wouldn't show on the PIP window, and the Firefox developers have not yet written an adapter for the subs on Crunchyroll.

When investigating to see how I could work around this, I found the JSON file that provides the links for a given video stream and its subs. While my initial plan was to convert CR's provided subfile to WebVTT, then inject those onto the video player, I noticed a "hardsub" section on the file. Apparently, this is used to display subs in the mobile apps. Could I simply tell the player to use the hardsub stream instead of the regular one, and to ignore softsubs entirely? Yes, yes I could.

I hacked together most of the functionality in a few hours, so a lot of stuff is very janky. I've never written a browser extension before, so this was also a fun learning experience for me!

When switching subtitles, Widevine gets triggered (perhaps unsurprisingly), so the second toggle in the extension popup is to automatically refresh the page when switching subs. This should work when logged in, but does not work when logged out, from my testing. If logged out, disable "force hardsub" before switching languages.

I also have not tested this with audio languages other than Japanese. I have no clue if it will work or not in other cases. This very much was a hack done to solve a personal problem, not for widespread public usage. (I'm still probably publishing it in case others may need it, though, and have close to my exact use case).
