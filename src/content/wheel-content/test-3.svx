	National loaf. The words to many living today mean close to nothing. Yet, few other combinations of words could strike as much terror into the hearts of Brits during World War II as “national loaf”. Sometimes referred to as “Hitler’s secret weapon”, it was no secret that people were not a fan of national loaf. (Peterkin). What even is national loaf, and why was it so feared 522 grams of wholemeal flour, 174 grams of potato flour, 474 grams of water, 21 grams of yeast, and 600 milligrams of Vitamin C. Mixed, risen, and baked, that’s national loaf, or at least the ingredients that constitute it. But, obviously, this doesn’t tell the whole story, and behind this widely panned bread is a brief peek into the period of rationing in Britain.
	Although World War II began in September 1939, it wasn’t until January 8, 1940 that food was initially rationed, beginning simply with bacon, butter, and sugar. Several other foods would be slowly phased into rationing. Bread was introduced in 1939, which technically can be considered “national loaf”, yet it’s not the national loaf the country would grow to hate in the coming years. After “three years’ struggle in compelling the Ministry of Food at long last to supersede the 70% extraction of the national loaf by an 85% extraction”, national loaf in the form it would soon gain infamy for was introduced. (Graham-Little vol. 248). In other words, national loaf uses 85% of the wheat grain in its wholemeal flour (though it was eventually reduced to 80% after a few years). In this way, it can be compared to wheat bread, as opposed to white bread, which was much more common before the war.
	National loaf was applauded by nutritionists, politicians, and doctors, who found the national loaf to be “an excellent development”. (Lacey 108). Though, like the color of the bread, the reception was less than bright. National loaf has been described as having a “dreary color”, with an “inevitable tendency to staleness”. (Lacey 108-109). National loaf was likely the only bread people were able to obtain during the war, however. This was due an order from the Minister of Food “to prohibit the milling of white flour, except under very restricted conditions”. (Graham-Little vol. 239). People did not like this. To many, white bread tastes much better than wheat bread. And while national loaf initially closely matched the wheat content of white bread, “the final blow was struck” and it was ordered that wholemeal flour must contain 85% of the wheat grain. (“What’s” 605). The now wholegrain national loaf disgusted many, and some reports mention that only one in seven people found national loaf preferable to regular white bread.
	So, is the sole issue with the national loaf the fact that it was adjusted to be wholegrain, tasting worse than white bread? Yes, but it does go deeper than that, especially when looking at the quality control of the bread, as well as the technicalities behind the wholemeal flour. Apparently, the quality control of national loaf was quite awful: “The millers did not produce the flour to any uniform specification, the bakers often baked it badly or not at all”. (“What’s” 605). In addition, the Minister of Food’s definition of wholemeal “permit[ed] 85% national wheatmeal to consist of white flour with added bran”, and “it is the bran whose taste is disliked by those who do not care for brown bread”. (“What’s” 605). Out of seventeen loafs of national loaf sampled by researchers, seven of them had levels of “crude-fibre” above the recommended limit by the Medical Research Council, these of which “contained a large percentage of course bran”. (Mcdougall 69). So, alongside general distaste towards brown bread, and therefore national loaf, the allowance of adding bran to white flour for the recipe worsened the taste further. In addition, the fortification of the national loaf with calcium phosphates, something that was fiercely argued about in British medical journals, and only applies to some loaves, may have also impacted the flavor of the bread. (Evans no. 4205; Harris no. 4202; Harris no. 4204; Harris no. 6424; Harris no. 6149).
	It’s a bit difficult to determine what exactly the takeaway of national loaf is, though national loaf began a bit of resurgence recently. At the start of the pandemic, bakers baked national loaf in order to make better use of supply to keep up with demand. In addition, since it’s brown bread, it’s much healthier than regular white bread. (“British Bakers”). Maybe that’s the simple takeaway. Brown bread likely doesn’t please the palette nearly as much as white bread. Yet, at the same time, it’s undoubtedly the healthier option. While we take this knowledge for granted now, it wasn’t necessarily well known during World War II, leading to the widespread complaints about the bread due to its taste. But, in times like World War II, and in times like the pandemic, perhaps taste doesn’t matter nearly as much as health. Perhaps national loaf, disgusting as it may have been, was the right option for Brits for their health during a period of intense rationing.
